## Project: Pygame Space Invaders

### Topic: Challenges in the project
Response: I was very confused as my mental health isn't what it used to be, and I feel I may have misunderstood the project at many steps. Scoping to what I understood the project to be was very important, and I tried my best to get to that point.

### Topic: Advice to future student on this project
Response: Focus on one improvement at a time. I went full on doing 3 improvements at once and by the end of the project, I ended up with many of those improvements not implemented. As always, don't bite off more than you can chew, especially during the apocalypse.

### Topic: Most fun aspects of this assignment
Response: Artwork and making the tracking protocols for the ships and bullets. I love watching the homing missiles fly after ships, and I love watching the wave of enemy ships chase after the player's ship.

### Topic: Most challenging aspects of this assignment
Response: The original code was super simple to follow. When the main.py file was getting bigger and bigger, I had to split it off into separate files. If I had started on a clean slate, I feel I would have made a better design for this program. For starters, most of my constants and libraries are accessed in a strange way, and I repeated a few lines of code in multiple places. Ships and bullets are virtually the same but have their own individual classes. Art was completely redone to allow for multiple bullets, which was something the original game didn't allow, and I ended up throwing it all into a manager within the Game class which could have been more neatly handled.

### Topic: Most difficult part of the assignment to understand
Response: I guess I was at a point where I needed someone to show me what a finished project was supposed to look like. I feel if I saw someone else's work (preferably an A's job), I'd be able to scope my project better. I don't know if I did too much or too little at any given moment so I kept on adding and adding and adding.

### Topic: Improving the assignment in the future
Response: I loved this project, but maybe remind students not to spend too much time on this? Otherwise, lovely assignment. Fun, and helped me learn a bit more about PyGame.
